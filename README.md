# Trivia-Project
Text-based trivia game in C. Uses sockets to connect up to 3 users to play the game, and a server that hosts it. Reads from "questions.txt" (Can be changed as long as it follows the same format). Each user can enter their name and a score is kept for them. As soon as someone answers, it goes to the next question. At the end, the winner is announced.
